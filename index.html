  Coursera Practical Data Science Project - Done in May of 2014. 
  The challenge was to predict a class variable given roughly 150 predictors
  and evaluating the models based on prediction accuracy. A high accuracy was
  obtained using the Random Forest model without the need of any feature
  engineering. R was used for the modeling. My
  submission can be <a

    here.</a>

  Donorschoose.org Project on Kaggle - Done in June 2014. This challenge was to
  predict whether project submissions to Donorschoose.org would be marked as
  "exciting" by the potential donors to projects. There was a class imbalance in
  the target variable with roughly 5% of projects being "exciting." This was
  dealt with by downsampling the majority variable. A feature was engineered
  based on the length of the submitted essay text. The metric for model
  evaluation was AUC (Area under the ROC curve), and the highest AUC was
  obtained using Stochastic Gradient Boosting. Unfortunately, I missed the
  deadline to submit my predictions to Kaggle, but the code I used can be <a

  project but is a web application I built that aggregates telecommuting 
  job listings from Craigslist and outputs them in a format that makes job
  searching easier for its users. It currently averages 200 visitors per day
